        Moshe Kahn Advocates is a specialist business law firm that deal mainly
        in "Corporate Law". As a lawyer I had to manage a full range of legal
        services that encompasses many aspects of business, corporate,
        real-estete, and commercial law, including M&A transactions, and complex
        commercial litigation and dispute resolution proceedings.
